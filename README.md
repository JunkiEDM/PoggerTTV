# PoggerTTV
FFZ external addon loader &amp; custom global emote 

(Pronounced Poggert TV)

This is a proof of concept to show that it is possible to load unauthorized addons (and by extension emotes) into FFZ.

In the future, alternative emote backends will be supported.

### How to use:

Add this userscript to your browser: [Link](https://combinatronics.com/bbepis/PoggerTTV/master/userscript.user.js)

It is a mirror of `userscript.js` in this repo, so you're able to just copy paste the contents of that if you do not wish to use the url.

After refreshing, you will then get a new addon appearing in FFZ labeled "PoggerTTV" which needs to be enabled.

### Current emotes

These are all emotes that are enabled globally with this extension. Some of them are banned from their respective services.

If you would like an emote to be added to this list and you have a compelling argument, open an issue.
